# Kitchen Recipes

This project is a small static website showcasing a few simple recipes. It was created for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Home page listing the recipes.
- `recipes/` - Folder containing an HTML page for each recipe.
- `images/` - Images used by the recipe pages.
- `styles.css` - Shared style sheet applied across all pages.

## Opening the Site

You can open the site locally by opening `index.html` in your web browser. Each recipe links to its own page within the `recipes/` directory. No web server is required; simply double-click the file or open it through your editor's live preview.
